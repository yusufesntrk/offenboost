# Data Storytelling

Transform raw data into compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire action.

## When to Use This Skill

- Presenting analytics to executives
- Creating quarterly business reviews
- Building investor presentations
- Writing data-driven reports
- Communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- Making recommendations based on data

## Core Concepts

### Story Structure

```
Setup → Conflict → Resolution

Setup: Context and baseline
Conflict: The problem or opportunity
Resolution: Insights and recommendations
```

### Narrative Arc

1. **Hook**: Grab attention with surprising insight
2. **Context**: Establish the baseline
3. **Rising Action**: Build through data points
4. **Climax**: The key insight
5. **Resolution**: Recommendations
6. **Call to Action**: Next steps

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Components |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Data** | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons |
| **Narrative** | Meaning | Context, causation, implications |
| **Visuals** | Clarity | Charts, diagrams, highlights |

## Story Frameworks

### The Problem-Solution Story

```markdown
# Customer Churn Analysis

## The Hook
"We're losing $2.4M annually to preventable churn."

## The Context
- Current churn rate: 8.5% (industry average: 5%)
- Average customer lifetime value: $4,800

## The Problem
Analysis reveals: 73% churned within first 90 days
Common factor: < 3 support interactions

## The Insight
Customers who don't engage in the first 14 days
are 4x more likely to churn.

## The Solution
1. Implement 14-day onboarding sequence
2. Proactive outreach at day 7

## Expected Impact
- Reduce early churn by 40%
- Save $960K annually

## Call to Action
Approve $50K budget for onboarding automation.
```

### The Comparison Story

```markdown
## The Question
Should we expand into EMEA or APAC first?

| Factor      | Weight | EMEA Score | APAC Score |
|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Market Size | 25%    | 5          | 4          |
| Growth      | 30%    | 3          | 5          |
| Competition | 20%    | 2          | 4          |
| Ease        | 25%    | 2          | 3          |
| **Total**   |        | **2.9**    | **4.1**    |

## The Recommendation
APAC first. Higher growth, less competition.
```

## Visualization Techniques

### Progressive Reveal

```
Slide 1: "Revenue is growing" [single line chart]
Slide 2: "But growth is slowing" [add growth rate overlay]
Slide 3: "Driven by one segment" [add segment breakdown]
Slide 4: "Which is saturating" [add market share]
Slide 5: "We need new segments" [add opportunity zones]
```

### Contrast and Compare

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│    BEFORE       │     AFTER       │
│  Process: 5 days│  Process: 1 day │
│  Errors: 15%    │  Errors: 2%     │
│  Cost: $50/unit │  Cost: $20/unit │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## Headlines That Work

```markdown
BAD: "Q4 Sales Analysis"
GOOD: "Q4 Sales Beat Target by 23% - Here's Why"

BAD: "Customer Churn Report"
GOOD: "We're Losing $2.4M to Preventable Churn"

Formula:
[Specific Number] + [Business Impact] + [Actionable Context]
```

## Transition Phrases

**Building the narrative:**
- "This leads us to ask..."
- "When we dig deeper..."
- "The pattern becomes clear when..."

**Introducing insights:**
- "The data reveals..."
- "What surprised us was..."
- "The key finding is..."

**Moving to action:**
- "This insight suggests..."
- "Based on this analysis..."
- "Our recommendation is..."

## Handling Uncertainty

```markdown
Acknowledge limitations:
- "With 95% confidence, we can say..."
- "The sample size of 500 shows..."
- "While correlation is strong, causation requires..."

Present ranges:
- "Impact estimate: $400K-$600K"
- "Confidence interval: 15-20% improvement"
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Start with the "so what"** - Lead with insight
- **Use the rule of three** - Three points, three comparisons
- **Show, don't tell** - Let data speak
- **Make it personal** - Connect to audience goals
- **End with action** - Clear next steps

### Don'ts
- **Don't data dump** - Curate ruthlessly
- **Don't bury the insight** - Front-load key findings
- **Don't use jargon** - Match audience vocabulary
- **Don't show methodology first** - Context, then method
- **Don't forget the narrative** - Numbers need meaning
